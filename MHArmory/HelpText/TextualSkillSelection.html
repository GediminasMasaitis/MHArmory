Text-based skill selection

<body style='font-family:"Segoe UI"'>
In the skills selection window, it is possible to use the search bar to quickly toggle skills selection.<br/>
When text is typed in the search bar, only matching results remain. For example if <b>attack</b> is typed, all skills containing <b>attack</b> in their name, their description, the description of the abilities it grants or the name of its related jewel(s), will remain in view.<br/><br/>
It is also possible to append a number at the end of a search in order to express the will to match a given level for a given skill, for example <b>attack 6</b>. This will apply filter to keep all skills matching <b>attack</b> and that have a level or 6, meaning only <b><span style="color: blue">Attack Boost</span></b> should remain. Then pressing the <b><span style="color: dimgray">Enter</span></b> key will toggle the selection of the <b><span style="color: blue">Attack Boost</span></b> level 6 ability.<br/>
If <b>speed 3</b> is typed, only <b><span style="color: blue">Recovery Speed</span></b>, <b><span style="color: blue">Speed Eating</span></b> and <b><span style="color: blue">Speed Sharpening</span></b> should remain. Now, pressing the <b><span style="color: dimgray">Enter</span></b> key will toggle selection of the level 3 of all the filtered skills.
